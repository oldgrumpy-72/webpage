            <p> The period of self-isolation has ended. Already good. Yesterday I finally got my discharge papers. I've been waiting since April 6.
                A new stage of life begins. It's time to do something new, learn something new. New project. New knowledge. In General I'm moving on
                in the active search for a new job. I can't say that I spent my time at home in vain. I learned a lot of new things, right
                as at last there was a lot of free time to study those disciplines in which there was clearly not enough experience and knowledge.
                But I'm really tired of sitting at home. I'm not the right person</p>
