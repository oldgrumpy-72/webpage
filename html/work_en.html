                it was even a little scary, especially in terminology (PDH, SDH, ATM, VOIP and more). But then I realized - I already studied it, only the names were
                Russians. And it has become easier. The advantage was that the company’s management had very high level connections, at the level of top managers of the largest telecom companies
                and it allowed to get to know many of them and learn a lot. That is why I am so dear to the experience gained in this company, the experience which
                I was greatly helped in my future activities.</p>

            <p class="tx" style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px">
                This would be the first experience as a product manager. At the start of the project, the company was mainly engaged in the development and sale of
                transport network equipment (PDH, SDH, PPL) and access equipment (DSL). It was necessary from scratch to develop a whole line of products (IP, VOIP, ADSL),
                a marketing policy for new products and a sales strategy tailored to the specifics of the company. It was difficult, but interesting. A team was formed,
                analyzed as the market of potential Customers and vendors working in this market, promising technologies and prospects for the development of technologies.
                Equipment certification has been carried out, price lists, equipment sales strategy and necessary marketing materials have been developed. All this was done
                within a fairly limited budget. In the future, the launch of the equipment line in sales allowed us to increase the company's turnover by 4-5 times. If you rate
                the volume of the project in monetary terms - then in the next 6-7 years after the launch of the equipment line, the company earned more than 1 billion rubles in sales
                this equipment and expanded its customer base by about 30%.

            <p class="tx" style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px">
                This project was probably the hardest and most interesting of all. And perhaps the most useful for personal development.
                It began with the fact that I found a niche that could be entered. This niche is maintenance and repair of measuring equipment
                of the entire KAMAZ holding. I found investors who were interested in this topic. He formed a team, which is still proud of.
                Created a new company. Received the necessary licenses and certificates. This was a team that did not work not for fear, but for conscience.
                Yes, I had to study an unknown topic for me. But it all worked out. 5-year framework contract with annual extension,
                several branches, more than 200 production personnel, necessary equipment and machinery. Yes, it was very difficult.
                It is very difficult to provide round-the-clock service for such a manufacturing giant as KAMAZ. It was even physically and morally difficult to manage this project.
                I had to study during the project, almost continuously. But it was very interesting and informative.
                Gave such experience in project management, which would probably be hard to get in other conditions.
                And once again I want to note my team, if it weren’t for her help and dedication, probably a lot would be more complicated,
                and perhaps it wouldn’t work out. If you evaluate from a financial point of view - then the company has earned over five years more than 1 billion rubles

            <p class="tx" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 10px"> Group of companies "EnergoTelecom" </p>
            <p class="tx" style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px">
                The EnergyTelecom project was the first crisis management project in my life.
                EnergoTelecom was the management company of the holding, in which there were several large projects,
                including mine in KAMAZ. In 2010, all projects except KAMAZ came to a standstill.
                Shareholders proposed to head the management company. I had a difficult project on KAMAZ,
                which required my attention, but the arrival of a new person in the management company
                to the position of director could create an even more difficult situation. I had to make a difficult decision.
                The management company had a lot of problems - huge debts, existing contracts on the verge of breaking
                on the part of Customers, a practically non-working team. I had to change the team, negotiate with customers,
                resolve the financial situation. I can’t say that everything worked out to the end, but at least
                the new team was able not only to extend existing contracts for another 1.5 years, but also to pay off 90% of debts
                that hung on the company with a heavy load. Of course, these measures helped a lot, but the crisis
                which was before that made shareholders eventually change their business strategy and abandon EnergoTelecom projects.
                This was bad, as it hit the project at KAMAZ, which had to be curtailed in 2013 due to a change in the shareholder strategy. Возможно, если бы начать изменять ситуацию по ЭнергоТелекому хотя бы на год раньше, многие проекты работали бы до сих пор. Но не сложилось.

            <p class="tx" style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px">

                RedSys for me was a new step in my development. It was a software project management project.
                It was necessary not only to interact with Customers, but also to participate in the development team as the owner of the Product.
                Plus, experience not only with those Customers with whom I worked previously on various projects (mobile Operators,
                fixed-line providers, industrial enterprises and government agencies) but also with enterprises
                fuel and energy complex. Plus, it gave development in terms of technology - that’s what I needed knowledge in part
                artificial intelligence, machine learning, knowledge of the basics of programming, low-code platforms, English and others.
                Plus, I found the application of my knowledge regarding the organization of production processes at industrial enterprises
                (monitoring of production processes, the collection and processing of technological information and other practical knowledge).
